        desp : "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It provides a set of tags that define the structure and content of a web document, including text, images, links, forms, and other elements. HTML is essential for creating the basic structure of a webpage and specifying how content should be displayed in a web browser. Each HTML tag serves a specific purpose. For example, `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags define headings of varying sizes, `<p>` tags define paragraphs, `<a>` tags create hyperlinks, `<img>` tags insert images, and `<form>` tags define interactive forms for user input. By using a combination of these tags, web developers can create rich and interactive user experiences on the web.HTML documents are typically written in plain text and saved with a `.html` file extension. They are parsed by web browsers to render the content visually to users. HTML works hand in hand with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to enhance the appearance and functionality of web pages, making it a fundamental technology for web development."

        desp : "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for describing the presentation and styling of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) documents on the web. It allows web developers to control the layout, appearance, and behavior of elements on a webpage across different devices and screen sizes. CSS works by targeting HTML elements using selectors and applying styles to them. Selectors can be based on element types (e.g., div, p), classes (e.g., .container, .btn), IDs (e.g., #header, #sidebar), attributes , and more complex criteria. Once selected, styles can be applied to elements to define properties such as color, size, spacing, alignment, font, background, and animation effects. One of the key features of CSS is its cascading nature, where styles can be inherited from parent elements and overridden or extended by more specific selectors or styles defined later in the document or in external style sheets. This allows for consistency in design and efficient management of styles across multiple pages of a website."

        desp : "JavaScript (JS) is a versatile programming language primarily used for building interactive and dynamic functionality within web pages. As a core technology of the web alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript enables developers to create engaging user experiences, handle data asynchronously, and manipulate the content and behavior of web pages in real-time. JS was initially developed to add interactivity to static web pages by allowing developers to write scripts that execute on the client-side (in the user's web browser). Over time, JavaScript has evolved into a robust and full-fledged programming language with a wide range of capabilities. JavaScript continues to evolve with new language features (ES6 and beyond), improved performance, and expanded capabilities, making it a foundational technology for front-end and full-stack web development. Its versatility and widespread adoption ensure that JavaScript remains a critical tool for creating modern web applications and interactive user experiences."
